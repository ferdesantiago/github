# Questions and answers
- Describe the major design/build decisions and why you made them.
  A: I wanted to use tailwind instead of pure CSS, but at the end I decided to use pure CSS because there is a section in the presentation that says that the CSS skill will be reviewed
- How long did the assignment take (in hours)? Please break down your answer into buckets (e.g. "Learning Framework", "Coding", "Debugging").
  A: It took me around 7 hours:
    - 2 hours: reading, understading, creating the scaffolding of the project, creating repo and selecting third party libraries to use.
    - 4 hours: coding -> testing -> fixing. Several iterations.
    - 1 hour: Final testing, tried to break the app, created documentation, etc.
- If you could go back and give yourself advice at the beginning of the project, what would it be?
  A: I had a minor issue with the graphic library so I would have put more attention to it and also read more about the github API that after some requests it blocks you.
- Did you learn anything new?
  A: Yes, I learned about the graphic library and github API.
- Do you feel that this assignment allowed you to showcase your abilities effectively?
  A: Yes. We can add more features like Jest/Cypress e2e testing, multiples pages, or even a MUI or tailwind, but I think this assessment is good enough.
- Are there any significant web development-related skills that you possess that were not demonstrated in this exercise? If so, what are they?
  A: e2e testing and MUI or tailwind.
